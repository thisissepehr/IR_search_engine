Those genes were classified into three categories: molecular transport, amino acid metabolism, and infectious diseases. The IPA analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in pathways including interferon signaling, water and ion transportation, nutrient (glucose, lipids and amino acids) absorption, metabolism and transport. Therefore, the expression of intestinal nutrient transporters and subsequently the absorptive function may be dramatically altered in response to PEDV infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify intestinal gene expression in PDEV-infected pigs by using microarray analyses. There is very little information available on the regulation of intestinal transporters in piglets by PEDV infection [22] [23] [24] [25] . Schweer 26 found that PEDV infection decreased the GLUT2 mRNA level but increased the SLC6A14 level in the piglet jejunum. In addition, Wang et al. 9 reported reductions in the mRNA levels for FABP2 in the jejunum of PDEV-infected piglets. Our results are consistent with those from these two studies although SLC6A14 expression was not determined in the present study. Regarding the omic studies with PEDV-infected pigs, Sun et al. 22 found that PEDV infection enhanced the expression of 7044 genes and most of them were related to the immune response to infectious disease pathways.

Similarly, an in vitro study involving the RNA-seq analysis of Vero E6 cells revealed that the DEGs were mainly related to the immune response and the mTOR signaling pathway that play a vital role in PEDV antiviral regulation 23 .

There are extensive studies regarding the effects of virus on the expression of glucose transporters.

Amino acids are preferential nutrients for the intestinal tract to synthesize intestinal proteins, polyamines, nitric oxide, ATP, and other products with enormous biological function [48] [49] [50] . In the present study, amino acid profiles in both plasma and jejunum were dramatically altered by PEDV infection. Specifically, basic amino acid (histidine, lysine, and arginine) concentrations were reduced in the jejunal mucosa of PEDV-infected piglets. Arginine is considered to be the nitrogenous precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide and as a regulator to prevent cell death and promote protein synthesis [51] [52] [53] . It can be synthesized from citrulline in plasma and from ornithine in the mitochondria of intestinal mucosa catalyzed by ASS1 30 . Arginine is metabolized in two ways: one is that arginine is decomposed into ornithine and urea catalyzed by arginase 1 (ARG1), the other is that arginine is metabolized into citrulline and NO catalyzed by NO synthase (NOS) 54 . In the present study, PEDV infection up-regulated ASS1 and ARG1 gene expression in the jejunal mucosa, indicating the abnormality of arginine metabolism. Besides, expression of basic amino acid transporters b 0,+ AT and y + LAT1 was down-regulated in PEDV-infected piglets, which may explain the reduction of basic amino acids. b 0,+ AT1 and rBAT are located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells and are responsible for transporting basic amino acids and cystine into cells from the intestinal lumen, while exchanging neutral amino acids 55, 56 . y + LAT1 is located in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and is responsible for transporting basic amino acids into the blood from the intestinal cells while exchanging neutral amino acids 57 . Intriguingly, concentrations of acidic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) were increased, while an acidic amino acid transporter SLC1A1 was down-regulated in the jejunum of PEDV-infected piglets. Wu 58 reported that glutamate and aspartate, along with glutamine, are the major energy substrates for enterocytes. These amino acids play an important role in pig growth performance, gene expression regulation, cell signaling pathway, tight-junction integrity, hormone secretion, antioxidant capacity, and neural regulation [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . The higher content of acidic amino acids in the jejunum may be due to the higher demand for these amino acids under pathological conditions. Other amino acids, including asparagine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were increased in the PEDV group in both the jejunal mucosa and plasma, which might be related to the up-regulated expression of neutral amino acid transporters, such as B 0 AT1 and ASCT2 64 . However, glycine and cysteine (two of the three substrates for GSH synthesis), as well as proline, threonine, hydroxyproline, taurine, and alanine were decreased in the jejunal mucosa and plasma after PEDV infection, indicating disorders in protein metabolism and amino acid absorption. PepT1 is the transporter of di-and tri-peptides, locating in the brush border of the intestine 65,66 . Osmanyan et al. 56 reported that the end-products of protein digestion, i.e. small peptides and amino acids, may affect the expression of PepT1. In the present study, the reduction in PepT1 expression in the PEDV group further demonstrates the abnormal metabolism of protein and amino acids in PEDV-infected piglets. Moreover, plasma urea concentration is an indicator of amino acid metabolism in the body and may be negatively correlated with piglet growth performance 67 . Therefore, PEDV infection may inhibit protein synthesis, while stimulating protein degradation and amino acid catabolism in the whole body. Taken together, PEDV infection may promote the degradation of body protein and impair intestinal amino acid absorption, transport and metabolism by altering the expression of amino acid transporters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 277, "end": 281, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 282, "end": 286, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 704, "end": 708, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 847, "end": 849, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1078, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1628, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1631, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1836, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2043, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2363, "end": 2367, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2372, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2373, "end": 2377, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2382, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2387, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3199, "end": 3201, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3653, "end": 3655, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Moreover, lipid transport and metabolism may also be regulated by PEDV infection in piglets. PEDV could interfere with fatty acid transport by down-regulating the expression of FABP1, FABP2, and SLC27A4 in jejunal and ileal mucosae. FABP1 and FABP2 are predominantly expressed in the proximal and distal part of the small intestine, respectively 68 . Both of them play an important role in uptake, transport, and metabolism of fatty acids. SLC27A4 functions mainly as a transporter which transports long-chain fatty acids across the plasma membrane and seems to be the principal fatty acid transporter in enterocytes 69, 70 . A decrease in FABP1, FABP2, and SLC27A4 expression may result in inhibition of fatty acid absorption and transport by enterocytes. However, FABP6 expression was increased by PEDV infection in the ileum of piglets. Furuhashi et al. 68 showed that FABP6 could bind bile acids, the metabolites of cholesterol, and are crucial for the absorption and transport of lipids and vitamins. Therefore, PEDV can differentially regulate the expression of intestinal lipid transporters. Furthermore, PEDV may decrease the synthesis of fatty acids by down-regulating SLC27A2, ACSL3 and FASN expression in the small intestine. SLC27A2 and ACSL3 are isozymes of the long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase family, which convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and hence play a crucial part in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation 71 . FASN catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids, which are precursors of nutritionally and physiologically significant mono-unsaturated fatty acids in animals, including pigs 67 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 621, "end": 623, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 857, "end": 859, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1474, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1671, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Intriguingly, results of the present study indicated that lipoprotein secretion could be regulated by PEDV infection as APOA1, APOA4 and APOC2 expression were down-regulated in the jejunum and ileum of piglets. APOA1 is the main protein component of HDL in plasma and, therefore, is important for promoting cholesterol efflux from tissues to the liver for excretion 72, 73 . Down-regulation of the APOA1 gene is associated with HDL deficiencies. APOC2 is the component of very low density lipoprotein. Liu et al. 74 reported that APOC2 could activate LPL (an enzyme on the outer surface of endothelial cells that is responsible for the hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides), thereby playing an important role in converting triglycerides into free fatty acids for cells. APOA4 participates in the maturation of HDL and assisting APOC2 activation of LPL, and plays a vital role in the reverse transport of cholesterol. Hence, it is apparent that PEDV infection decreased the concentration of plasma HDL through the reduction of intestinal APOA1 and APOA4 expression (Fig. 4) .
