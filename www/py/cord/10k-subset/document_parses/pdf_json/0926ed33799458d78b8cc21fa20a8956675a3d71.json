Spurred by the importance of both coumarins and CA4, we decided to explore the synthesis and bioactivities of a class of compounds we dub 1,4-triazolyl combretacoumarins. There are, of course, isomeric 1,4-and 1,5-combretacoumarins ( Figure 2 ). Among the two, the latter class, which would be equivalent to (Z)-CA4, could be quite interesting due to the proximal disposition of two aryl rings and, in this context, 1,5triazolyl combretastatin analogs have been prepared. [33] In the present case, synthesis of this regioisomer would require reaction of a magnesiated alkyne with an azide, [34] but the organometallic reagent would be incompatible with the coumarin. Use of Ru-catalysis is known to yield 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles, [35] but this was unproductive in the present study (see the Supporting Information).

However, neither modification led to any improvement. The strong mesomeric effect of a pmethoxy group leading to increased electron density at the terminal alkynyl carbon atom could be a factor for this outcome. This effect could also influence the cycloaddition itself.

This involves activation of the 4-hydroxyl group with BOP and DBU in MeCN. The intermediate O 4 -(benzotriazolyl)coumarin derivatives formed in situ, possibly via the intermediacy of a phosphonium ion, can be reacted with NaN 3 and 18-crown-6 to give the 4-azidocoumarins. These products were subjected to CuAAC reactions with 5ethynyl-1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene using [(MeCN) 4 Cu]PF 6 in CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH, and 2,6-lutidine as additive, at 50 o C. Critical to the success of these reactions was the need for both MeOH and 2,6-lutidine. Using these conditions, seven 1,4-combretacoumarins and one phenyl derivative, 1-phenyl-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole, were synthesized. The latter was prepared in order to compare the reactivities of the 4-azidocoumarins with PhN 3 . Interestingly, although the azidocoumarins required an elevated temperature to attain complete reactions, PhN 3 reacted at room temperature and within a shorter reaction time. To understand possible reasons for this difference in reactivities, DFT computations were utilized to evaluate the NBO coefficients of the azido groups in the 4azidocoumarins but a link between the NBO coefficients on the nitrogen atoms of the azido groups and reactivity was not forthcoming. However, a difference was observed between the azido coumarins and PhN 3 . Four desmethoxy 1,4-combretacoumarins were prepared from reactions of 4-azido-6-bromo-2H-chromen-2-one (6) with two di-and two mono-methoxy phenylacetylenes. In these reactions, we found that the structures of the phenylacetylenes also influence the CuAAC reactions, and DFT computations were used to assess the NBO coefficients of the alkynyl carbon atoms. As anticipated, the terminal alkynyl carbon atom has a greater negative charge when a p-methoxy group is present. The varying electronic properties of the alkynes are likely also linked to the subtle reactivity differences observed. Antiproliferative and antiviral assays were undertaken. Unfortunately, the 1,4-combretacoumarins suffered from solubility problems. Among the various compounds, 1-phenyl-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3triazole (20) was relatively soluble and showed antiproliferative effect, appearing to operate via an apoptotic pathway due to significant phosphotidylserine (PS) externalization. Three of the four desmethoxy compounds showed comparable cytotoxicity against CEM cells. Of these, 6-bromo-4-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-2H-chromen-2-one (23) was also selective for MB-231 cells. However, this compound did not demonstrate appreciable PS externalization, in contrast to 1-phenyl-4-(3,4,5trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole (20) . None of the compounds synthesized showed significant antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses.
