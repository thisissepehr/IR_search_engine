In this paper, we develop an epidemiological model that includes various controlling measures to systematically evaluate their effects on the disease transmission dynamics. By fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia until March 22, 2015, we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. Model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation, below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more Ebola infection. This challenges an existing view. Media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size. The response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries.

We obtained data of the total cumulative cases and deaths (as the sum of confirmed, probable and suspected cases) for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia from the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 .

We compiled publicly available time series of reported cases and deaths from WHO beginning from 22 March 2014, 27 May 2014, and 17 June 2014 for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, respectively 20, 21 .

Figure 2 shows that the model provides a very good fit to the reported data of both infected cases and deaths in all three countries. Using our parameter estimates (Table 1) , we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively.

Effect of isolation on R 0 and the final epidemic size. To explore the effect of early and broad diagnosis on the basic reproduction number R 0 , we calculate the derivative of R 0 with respect to the parameter \u03b8 (i.e. the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset) as follows", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1551, "end": 1555, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1560, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1565, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1570, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 299, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 455, "end": 464, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 668, "end": 675, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 774, "end": 780, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1248, "text": "Fig. 3(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1353, "text": "Fig. 3(b,c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1626, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1740, "text": "Fig. 4(a-c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The derivative is greater than 0 when \uf0f2 > for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia respectively (see Table 1 blue lines in Fig. 5) , respectively, which are all less than their respective threshold. Thus, increasing the fraction \u03b8 of detecting pre-symptomatic cases results in a decline in the basic reproduction number. If the effectiveness of isolation increases to 80%, i.e., the relative transmissibility \uf0f2 of isolated individuals decreases to 20% (magenta lines in Fig. 5 ), then about 35%, 65%, 60% of pre-symptomatic patients need to be detected in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to control the disease. If the isolation is perfect \uf0f2 ( = ) 0 , then the disease could be controlled easily (see yellow lines in Fig. 5 ). Next, we study the effect of the fraction \u03b8 of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset on the final epidemic size, which is defined as Z = C I (t 1 ) = C D (t 1 ) + R(t 1 ) 29 . The time t 1 is min{t > 0,E 1 (t) + E 2 (t) + I(t) + J(t) + D(t) = 0}. Although the explicit formula between the final size Z and \u03b8 cannot be obtained, there exists a threshold which decides whether the final epidemic size increases as \u03b8 increases. The relationship between Z and \u03b8 is similar to that between R 0 and \u03b8. For example, it follows from Fig. 6 (a) that if the effectiveness of isolation is lower than 11.76%, i.e., the relative transmissibility \uf0f2 of isolated class is greater than 88.24%, then the final epidemic size increases as \u03b8 increases. This suggests that strict measures must be taken to limit the contact of isolated individuals. Otherwise, low effectiveness of isolation would lead to more infected individuals because isolated people live longer due to improved medical care and have more chances to infect other people.
